# My Anime List Clone

A re-designed mini-clone of [myanimelist.net](https://myanimelist.net/), using the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/).

## Motivation

I've been an otaku for 10 years. As a student in General Assembly coding bootcamp, I was assigned a project to make a React application, using a public API. I instantly gravitated towards anime, and found the Jikan API.

## Build Status

**Version 1.0**

## Tech/Framework Used

Built with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html_.)

## Libraries

- [@brainhubeu/react-carousel](https://brainhubeu.github.io/react-carousel/docs/gettingStarted)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [lodash.throttle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.throttle)

## How to use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
